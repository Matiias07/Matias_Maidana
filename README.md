### Hi there üëã

My name is Mat√≠as and I am an enthusiastic person, proactive and open to challenges, visualizing the goals and giving 100% to achieve what is proposed.

üíª I am passionate about technology and development, plus curiosity led me to enter and train as a Full Stack Developer in the Soy Henry bootcamp.

ü§ì During my time at I'm Henry, I've gained a solid understanding of web development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I've also gained experience with frameworks like React, Redux, Vite, and Node.js, and I'm comfortable working with Express for backend development. In addition, I have experience managing PostgreSQL databases, which has allowed me to understand how to efficiently design and manage data persistence in my projects.
In the Soy Henry bootcamp I have developed a single page application, over the course of two weeks on my own. I have also participated in collaborative projects where I have been able to develop solid skills in teamwork, effective communication and problem solving in agile environments.

üòé I am committed to acquiring new skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions and I am looking for opportunities to apply and expand my skills in a professional setting.
